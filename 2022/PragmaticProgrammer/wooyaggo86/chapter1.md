* A Pragmatic Philosophy
    * It's Your Life
        * It is _your_ life. You own it. You run it. You create it.
        * “Why can't you change it?”
        * Tip 3 - You Have Agency
            * Does your work environment suck? Is your job boring? Try to fix it. But don't try forever. As Martin Fowler says, “you can change your organization or change your organization.”[3]
        * C. 내가 진짜로 원하는게 뭘까를 생각해 보게 되는 챕터. 마틴 파울러가 말한 글귀에 너무 공감한다.
    * The Cat Ate My Source Code
        * Team Trust
        * Take Responsibility
        * Tip 4 - Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
            * Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can't be done, is late, or is broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How's it going to sound to your boss?
        * C. Team Trust를 얻자. 그러기 위해서는 Take Responsibility를 해야한다. 그리고 프로답게 행동하자.

        * Tip 5 - Don't Live with Broken Windows
            * Don't leave “broken windows'' (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then _board it up._ Perhaps you can comment out the offending code, or display a “Not Implemented” message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take _some_ action to prevent further damage and to show that you're on top of the situation.
        * C. 시간이 지나면 모든 것들은 썩는다. 손을 댈 수 없어지기 전에 정돈하자. 하지만, 현실에서는 손을 댈 수 없어질 때까지 기다려야지만, 손을 댈 수 있는 명분이 생기는 것 같기도 하다..
    * Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
        * But more importantly, the soldiers act as a catalyst, bringing the village together so they can jointly produce something that they couldn't have done by themselves—a synergistic result. Eventually everyone wins.

        * Tip 7 - Remember the Big Picture
            * Q. 개구리 이야기와 Big Picture가 어떻게 연결되는지 모르겠네요.
        * C. 변화를 이끄는 촉매역할을 해야하는건 정말 중요합니다. 그런데 예제들이 마음에 와닿지 않네요. 오히려 결과를 내기위해 협상/흥정하는 느낌이 큽니다.
    * Good-Enough Software
        * C. 완벽한 소프트웨어를 만드는건 불가능하다.
            * Good enough for your users
        * C. 가치를 전달하는 소프트웨어를 만들어야 한다는 부분이 생각나네요.
        * Tip 8 - Make Quality a Requirements Issue
            * Often you'll be in situations where trade-offs are involved. Surprisingly, many users would rather use software with some rough edges today than wait a year for the shiny, bells-and-whistles version (and in fact what they will need a year from now may be completely different anyway). Many IT departments with tight budgets would agree. Great software today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow. If you give your users something to play with early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution (see Topic 12, ​Tracer Bullets​).
        * C. Good-enough가 Perfection보다 실용적이다.
    * Your Knowledge Portfolio
        * Your knowledge and experience are your most important day-to-day professional assets.
        * Your ability to learn new things is your most important strategic asset. But how do you learn how to learn, and how do you know what to learn?
        * **Your Knowledge Portfolio**
            * We like to think of all the facts programmers know about computing, the application domains they work in, and all their experience as their _knowledge portfolios._ Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:
                * Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.
                * Diversification is the key to long-term success.
                * Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.
                * Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
                * Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.
            * To be successful in your career, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio using these same guidelines.

            * Read a technical book each month
            * Read nontechnical books, too
            * Take classes
            * Participate in local user groups and meetups
            * Experiment with different environments
            * Stay current
        * The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things. The cross-pollination of ideas is important
        * Critical Thinking
        * Tip 10 - Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
            * Critical thinking is an entire discipline unto itself, and we encourage you to read and study all you can about it. In the meantime, here's a head start with a few questions to ask and think about.
                * Ask the “Five Whys”
                * Who does this benefit?
                * What's the context?
                * When or Where would this work?
                * Why is this a problem?
        * C. 너무 좋은 내용들이 많아서 발최한 내용도 많아졌네요. 다시 일어봐야겠습니다.
    * Communicate!
        * Tip 11 - English is Just Another Programming Language
        * Tip 12 - It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
            * Unless you work in a vacuum, you need to be able to communicate. The more effective that communication, the more influential you become.
        * Tip 13 - Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On
        * Summary
            * Know what you want to say.

            * Be a listener.
            * Get back to people.
            * Keep code and documentation together.
        * C. 커뮤니케이션은 모든 일에 중요하다. 항상 갈고 닦자.
